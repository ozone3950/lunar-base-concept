# Introduction

The Moon that you know of is a natural satelite that orbits around our planet, Earth. It is essensially a gigantic sphere of rocks and metals, around 27% the size of Earth. It is roughly 384,400 kilometres away from us and orbits at 3683 kilometres per hour. It is responsible for tides, stable climates, and even lighting up our night sky. On July the 20th 1969, humans have landed on the moon for the first time with Apollo 11, but that was over 5 decades ago, and our Moon hasn't got much attention at all since then.


# The Idea

It has been thought for quite a while that it is a good idea to create an outpost on the Moon, and the reasons for this keep getting larger as time goes on. One of the main reasons of this is that it will help humanity get used to surviving on harsh, isolated planets for further colonization, such as Mars. Lunar outposts could also help us with experimenting on radiation, since there is a lot of it on the moon due to it not having an atmosphere. The last reason that I will mention is resources. The moon has Helium-3, which is extremely rare on Earth and can be used to create fusion reactors in the near future. Rare Earth metals and other useful resources are also present there.
