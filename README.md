# Introduction

The Moon that you know of is a natural satelite that orbits around our planet, Earth. It is essensially a gigantic sphere of rocks and metals, around 27% the size of Earth. It is roughly 384,400 kilometres away from us and orbits at 3683 kilometres per hour. It is responsible for tides, stable climates, and even lighting up our night sky. On July the 20th 1969, humans have landed on the moon for the first time with Apollo 11, but that was over 5 decades ago, and our Moon hasn't got much attention at all since then.
