# Introduction

Our Moon that you know of is a natural satelite that orbits around our planet, Earth. It is essensially a gigantic sphere of rocks and metals, around 27% the size of Earth. It is roughly 384,400 kilometres away from us and orbits at 3683 kilometres per hour. It is responsible for tides, stable climates, and even lighting up our night sky. On July the 20th 1969, humans have landed on the moon for the first time with Apollo 11, but that was over 5 decades ago, and our Moon hasn't got much attention at all since then.

# The Idea

It has been thought for quite a while that it is a good idea to create an outpost on the Moon, and the reasons for this keep getting larger as time goes on. One of the main reasons of this is that it will help humanity get used to surviving on harsh, isolated planets for further colonization, such as Mars. Lunar outposts could also help us with experimenting with radiation, since there is a lot of it on the moon due to it not having an atmosphere. The last reason that I will mention is resources. The moon has Helium-3, which is extremely rare on Earth and can be used to create fusion reactors in the near future. Rare Earth metals and other useful resources are also present there. There are many other reasons for this being a good idea aswell. It is throught to take around 5-10 years to complete this operation and proceed with futher colonisation

# Base of the Concept

There are many diagrams and plans of concepts about Moon bases which I will talk about. The concepts have fundemental features such as:
- Compact size, since rocket payloads are rather small
- Designed for crew rotations every 6 months or so
- Flexible structures that can be set up in different environment, such as caves

The obvious parts to the plan are the usual with space travel. First off food - and a lot of it. The food must have all the correct nutrients for the human body to live and function correctly, be stored efficiently in order for humans to survive for months without any resupplies, and lastly, at least taste appealing.

Humans must also be exercising daily, to prevent muscle and bone fatigue 

The mental health of the crew is equally important to their physical health, since it will keep them motivated, more productive, and sane. 6 months shouldn't be too long for the crew to lose their sanity, and it will also endure them for longer, more harsh missions.
