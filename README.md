# Lunar Outpost Concept
Started on 7/3/22, written by Ozone.

## Introduction

Our Moon that you know of is a natural satelite that orbits around our planet, Earth. It is essensially a gigantic sphere of rocks and metals, around 27% the size of Earth. It is roughly 384,400 kilometres away from us and orbits at 3683 kilometres per hour. It is responsible for tides, stable climates, and even lighting up our night sky. On July the 20th 1969, humans have landed on the moon for the first time with Apollo 11, but that was over 5 decades ago, and our Moon hasn't got much attention at all since then.

## The Idea

It has been thought for quite a while that it is a good idea to create an outpost on the Moon, and the reasons for this keep getting larger as time goes on. One of the main reasons of this is that it will help humanity get used to surviving on harsh, isolated planets for further colonization, such as Mars. Lunar outposts could also help us with experimenting with radiation, since there is a lot of it on the moon due to it not having an atmosphere. The last reason that I will mention is resources. The moon has Helium-3, which is extremely rare on Earth and can be used to create fusion reactors in the near future. Rare Earth metals and other useful resources are also present there. There are many other reasons for this being a good idea aswell. It is throught to take around 5-10 years to complete this operation and proceed with futher colonisation.

## Base of the Concept

There are many diagrams and plans of concepts about Moon bases which I will talk about. The concepts have fundemental features such as:
- Compact size, since rocket payloads are rather small
- Designed for crew rotations every 6 months or so
- Flexible structures that can be set up in different environment, such as caves

The obvious parts to the plan are the usual with space travel. First off food - and a lot of it. The food must have all the correct nutrients for the human body to live and function correctly, be stored efficiently in order for humans to survive for months without any resupplies, and lastly, at least taste appealing.

Humans must also be exercising daily, to prevent muscle and bone loss. They would need to exercise with equipment specifically designed for space, due to micro gravity, since objects are lighter there. The Moon's surface gravity is approximately 1.62 m/s², which is around 6 times weaker than Earth's surface gravity of around 9.8 m/s². A solution that could be eventually implemented to this is a moving habitat, which simulates a closer surface gravity to Earth. 

The mental health of the crew is equally important to their physical health, since it will keep them motivated, more productive, and sane. 6 months shouldn't be too long for the crew to lose their sanity, and it will also endure them for longer, more harsh missions.

## The Artemis Program

The Artemis Program is a space exploration program mainly lead by NASA. The first stage of the plan is to land on and explore the moon, with a human landing happening by 2024. Later in the decade, sustainable exploration will be looked towards. It will contribute massively to the exploration and future colonisation of Mars, as the NASA astronauts will learn how to deal with the harsh conditions.

Artemis I will be an uncrewed Orion SLS (Space Launch System) rocket will be a demonstration of the performance of the SLS rocket and gather engeneering data before it returns to Earth at approximately 24,500 miles per hour (39400~ km/h). The reentry at this speed will be a test of the heat sheild's performance as it will heat up to almost 2760°C (5000°F). Throughout the 4-6 weeks that this mission will take, Orion will travel around 1.4 million miles which breaks the record that Apollo 13 currently held of distance travelled from Earth in a space craft which was designed for humans. Preperation and testing for the launch has already started, and production for the SLS engines has been completed. 

Artemis II will be the first manned flight of the mission, and the first time SLS and Orion has carried people. 4 astronauts will be sent to the moon, marking it the first time in more than 50 years by the time this happens. With the confidence and testing of the prior rocket, the mission will take around 10 days, and will also set the record for the farthest human travel, since it will be going beyond the far side of the moon in its return. The spacecraft will orbit Earth twice - both elliptical; the first orbit with an altitude of 115 by 1800 miles taking 90 around minutes, going into a high-Earth orbit (HEO) after the first firing of the interim cryogenic propulsion stage (ICPS), causing it to fly between 200 and 59000 miles above Earth for around 42 hours. After reaching this orbit, Orion will seperate from the ICPS. After HEO, Orion will take a path to the moon with a free-return trajectory, taking around 4 days to get to the moon. The path of Orion would have created a figure of 8 as it makes its way home after going around the moon. This demonstration will provide enough data for the beginning orf Artemis III.


Artemis III
